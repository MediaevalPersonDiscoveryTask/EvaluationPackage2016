### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MediaevalPersonDiscoveryTask/EvaluationPackage2016.git
$ cd EvaluationPackage2016
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Command line usage

### API usage

```python
>>> from metric import AveragePrecision
>>> average_precision = AveragePrecision('samples/reference.txt', K=[1, 10, 100])
>>> generator = average_precision('samples/hypothesis.txt')
>>> (ap1, ap10, ap100), n_relevant = generator.send('nicolas_sarkozy')
```

### File formats

#### Reference

`corpus_id video_id shot_id person_name`
* `corpus_id` is the corpus identifier (`DW`, `INA` or `3-24`)
* `video_id` is the video identifier within the corpus
* `shot_id` is the shot identifier within the video
* `person_name` is the normalized name of the person


#### Hypothesis

`corpus_id video_id shot_id hypothesized_person_name confidence`
* `corpus_id` is the corpus identifier (`DW`, `INA` or `3-24`)
* `video_id` is the video identifier within the corpus
* `shot_id` is the shot identifier within the video
* `person_name` is the normalized name of the person
* `confidence` is a confidence score

If two (or more) people are visible AND speaking within a shot, both people should be returned:
```
corpus_id video_id shot_id hypothesized_person_name_1 confidence_1
corpus_id video_id shot_id hypothesized_person_name_2 confidence_2
```

### Mean average precision (implementation details)

Given a `person_name` query, hypotheses are sorted in decreasing order of the normalized edit distance between `person_name` and the `hypothesized_person_name`. Tied hypotheses are then sorted in decreasing order of their `confidence` score.
In the (unlikely) case there remain tied hypotheses, those are sorted by their `temporal rank` within each video.


### Official results

#### Protocol

In order to use the same experimental protocol as the one used during the 2016 campaign, one should tune their algorithm with:


```bash
$ python metric.py --subset reference/test.leaderboard \
                   --verbose \
                   reference/reference.2016-09-14.txt \
                   YOUR_SUBMISSION_GOES_HERE.txt
```

and then evaluate with:


```bash
$ python metric.py --subset reference/test.eval \
                   --queries reference/queries.txt \
                   --verbose \
                   reference/reference.2016-10-16.txt \
                   YOUR_SUBMISSION_GOES_HERE.txt
```

`test.leaderboard` contains the subset of the test set used for computing the leaderboard during the development phase.

`reference.2016-09-14.txt` contains the state of annotations used for computing the leaderboard on the final day before the submission deadline.

`test.eval` contains the subset of the test set used for the final evaluation (intersection of `test.leaderboard` and `test.eval` is obviously empty).

`reference.2016-10-16.txt` contains the final version of the annotation, released around the dates of the debriefing workshop (October 20-21, near Amsterdam).

`queries.txt` contains the list of queries used for the final evaluation.

####  Submissions

`/submissions` directory contains runs submitted by participants.
